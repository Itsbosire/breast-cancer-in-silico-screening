# UF GenoForge Virtual Internship Programme 2025

## Project Title
**In Silico Screening of Plant-Derived Compounds Targeting Apoptosis Pathways in Breast Cancer**

## Research Focus
This original computational research project investigates the potential of bioactive plant compounds to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Using in silico techniques, interns will identify natural ligands, target key apoptosis-related proteins,and evaluate therapeutic potential through molecular docking and ADMET profiling.

## Objective
- To discover promising plant-derived compounds that can modulate apoptotic proteins in breast cancer, offering potential leads for future anti-cancer drug development.

### Internship Structure : Scope of Work
The following phases will be covered during the internship:
- **Literature Review**: Mining scientific studies for bioactive phytochemicals and apoptotic targets.

- **Protein & Ligand Selection**: Identifying and preparing protein structures and ligand molecules.

- **Molecular Docking**: Simulating ligand-protein interactions to evaluatebinding affinity.

- **ADMET Analysis**: Predicting pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and toxicity profiles.
- **Target Prediction**: Identifying off-target effects and additional protein interactions.
- **Result Compilation**: Visualizing data via graphs, figures, and tables. 
- **Manuscript Writing**: Collaboratively drafting a publication-ready original research article.

## Overview
Phase 1 task involves conducting a background literature review on plant-derived anticancer compounds. Two compounds were studied in detail: **Curcumin** and **Genistein**. The review focused on their source plants, target proteins/pathways, mechanisms of action cancer types treated, and reported efficacy.

## Compounds Reviewed

### 1. Curcumin
- **Source Plant**: *Curcuma longa* (Turmeric)
- **Target Pathways**:
  - PI3K-Akt Signal Pathway
  - JAK-STAT Signal Pathway
  - Wnt/β-Catenin Signal Pathway
  - p53 Signal Pathway
- **Mechanism of Action**:
  - Regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
  - Induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways and modulation of signaling axes like Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, and MAPK.
- **Cancer Types Treated**:
  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, and colon cancer.
- **Reported Efficacy**:
  - Suppresses tumor growth, induces apoptosis, inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
- **Citation**: [Curcumin Article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.660712)

### 2. Genistein
- **Source Plant**: *Glycine max* (Soybean)
- **Target Pathways**:
  - HPV oncogenes: E6 and E7
  - Tumor suppressor proteins: p53 and Rb
  - Apoptotic markers: Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2
  - Cell cycle regulators: Cyclin D1, CDK4
  - PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
- **Mechanism of Action**:
  - Downregulation of HPV oncogenes E6 and E7, restoring p53 and Rb functions.
  - Induction of apoptosis via intrinsic pathways.
  - Cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.
  - Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
- **Cancer Type Treated**:
  - Cervical cancer, specifically HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.
- **Reported Efficacy**:
  - Inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and causes cell cycle arrest in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.
- **Citation**: [Genistein Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.107)


## Conclusion
The literature review highlights the potential of plant-derived compounds like Curcumin and Genistein in targeting apoptosis pathways and treating various cancer types. These findings provide a strong foundation for further in silico screening and analysis.
