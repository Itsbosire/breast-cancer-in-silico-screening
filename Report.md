# Background Literature on Plant-Derived Anticancer Products
# Compound 1 : Curcumin

## Background Review of the compound
Curcumin [(1E,6E) -1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) hepta-1,6-diene-3,5- dione] is a natural polyphenol derived from the rhizome of the turmeric plant *Curcuma longa.* Accumulated evidences have presented curcumin’s function in terms of anti-inflammatory,antioxidant properties, and especially anti-tumor activities.

## Source Plant
Curcumin plant is derived from the rhizome of a tumeric plant known as *Curcuma longa*.

## Target Protein/Pathways
- **PI3K-Akt Signal Pathway** :is one of the major intracellular signaling pathways which has diverse downstream effects on basic intracellular functions, including cell proliferation, growth, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition(ETM),metabolism and motility . The aberrant activation of the signaling pathway is often closely related to the occurrence and development of human cancers .


- **JAK-STAT Signal Pathway** : Constitutive activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway was first recognized as being related with malignancy in the 1990’s.
The effects of JAK/STAT signaling on tumor cell survival,proliferation and invasion have made the JAK/STAT pathway a hotspot target for tumor targeted therapy and drug development.
Curcumin can inhibit the proliferation, migrationinvasion and promote apoptosis of retinoblastoma cells, which function through up-regulating the miR-99a expression and then inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling pathway.


- **Wnt/β-Catenin Signal Pathway** : Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, also called the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is a highly conserved pathway in evolution. Activation of Wnt pathways can modulate cell proliferation, apoptosis,differentiation, migration, invasion, genetic stability, cell renewal. β-catenin is the core component of the cadherin complex and its stabilization is essential for the activation of Wnt β-catenin signaling.

- **p53 Signal Pathway** : TP53 (p53), also described as the ‘guardian of the genome’, is the single most frequently altered gene in kinds of human cancers, the p53 mutations were observed in approximately 50% of all invasive tumors.

### Mechanism of Action
- Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol from turmeric, exhibits broad anticancer activity by interfering with numerous molecular targets implicated in cancer progression. It exerts its effects primarily through the regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

- Notably, curcumin upregulates tumor-suppressive miRNAs such as miR-206, miR-203, and miR-192-5p, while downregulating oncogenic miRNAs like miR-21 and lncRNA H19. These changes suppress oncogenic pathways and activate pro-apoptotic signaling.

- In terms of apoptosis, curcumin mediates the mitochondrial pathway through the activation of Bax and caspases 3/9, and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Curcumin has also been shown to enhance p53 expression, which in turn upregulates pro-apoptotic genes and sensitizes cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Moreover, it inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by downregulating Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling, key drivers of tumor growth and survival.

### Cancer Types Treated
Curcumin has demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects in a wide range of malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, and colon cancer.

### Reported Efficacy
Numerous preclinical studies have shown that curcumin suppresses tumor growth, induces apoptosis, inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and reduces angiogenesis. It enhances sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin and paclitaxel, and also potentiates the effect of radiotherapy. Curcumin analogs such as EF24 further enhance these effects by improving bioavailability and target specificity. Clinical trials are ongoing to validate these effects in humans, particularly in combination therapies.

### Conclusion
Curcumin represents a promising plant-derived anticancer agent with a well-characterized mechanism involving regulation of ncRNAs and key apoptotic pathways. Its ability to modulate multiple signaling axes and sensitize tumor cells to existing therapies underscores its potential for clinical application, particularly as an adjuvant in multi-modal cancertreatment strategies.

# Plant-derived anticancer Compound 2

# Compound Name : Genistein

# Source Plant : Glycine max (Soybean)

## Target Protein/Pathways
- HPV oncogenes: E6 and E7
- Tumor suppressor proteins: p53 and Rb
- Apoptotic markers: Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2
- Cell cycle regulators: Cyclin D1, CDK4
- PI3K/Akt signaling pathway


### Mechanism of Action
Genistein, a naturally occurring isoflavone, exhibits potent anticancer properties,
particularly against cervical cancer cells infected with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) strains. The compound exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms:

- **Downregulation of HPV Oncogenes**: Genistein significantly reduces the expression levels of E6 and E7 oncogenes. These viral proteins are known to inactivate tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively. By suppressing E6 and E7, genistein restores the normal functions of p53 and Rb, leading to controlled cell proliferation and apoptosis.

- **Induction of Apoptosis**: The treatment with genistein leads to the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways. This is evidenced by the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9, and the downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The shift in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio favors apoptosis, leading to programmed cell death in cancer cells.

- **Cell Cycle Arrest**: Genistein induces G1 phase arrest in cervical cancer cells. This is achieved by the downregulation of Cyclin D1 and CDK4, which are essential for the progression of cells from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The arrest preventsthe proliferation of cancer cells.

- **Inhibition of PI3K/Akt Pathway**: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. Genistein inhibits this pathway, thereby reducing cell survival signals and promoting apoptosis.

### Cancer Type Treated
Cervical cancer, specifically HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.

### Reported Efficacy
In vitro studies demonstrate that genistein effectively
inhibits the proliferation of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. The compound induces significant apoptosis and causes cell cycle arrest, leading to reduced tumor cell viability. These effects are dose-dependent and highlight genistein's potential as a therapeutic agent against cervical cancer.
